    "text": "2.2 Response\n\nA topic I’m curious about learning more about is how college athletes can use TikTok to build their own personal brand. A research question for that would be “How do collegiate college athletes use TikTok to shape their own personal image and engage with fans. I would begin by looking for popular college athletes on TikTok and look at the type of videos they have on their page. I would investigate their “personal brand” and how they present themselves to the public and how their fans are interacting with their content (likes, comments, shares, and following). I would also review any existing studies on social media branding, digital marketing, and athlete-to-fan communication to have a better understanding of information that’s already been found and any gaps that still need to be researched. I would then work on my design stage, where I would collect TikTok videos posted by NCAA athletes that represent content of them playing their sport, personal life, humor, trends, and endorsements. I would also measure the engagement they receive on those specific posts (likes, comments, shares). I would also consider the difference in male and female branding approaches, since my personal exposure has shown that female athletes receive different attention than men. An addition to that, I would look where athletes take advantage of the NIL (name, image, and likeness) offers to promote any endorsements they receive from companies. I would set up interviews with those specific athletes that I gathered data from to gain their perspective about their own branding strategies, what their goals are with their posts, and how they think their audience perceives them. For the data collecting stage, I would identify between 40-50 athletes who are active on TikTok and gather a specific number of their most recent/most viewed posts (around 15 videos) to keep my data consistent. I would set up a Zoom call with the athletes to interview them and record their responses. In the data analysis stage, I would first examine the engagement the athletes received on their videos and compare them to the type of video it is (ex., lifestyle, humor, trendy). I would see what type of videos gained the most views, likes, shares, and comments. I would then look at the response from the interviews and see if I can identify any patterns from what the athletes said. I would then compare these two sets of data and see if there were any connections between them. In my final step, I would create a presentation of my findings and present them to collegiate athletes through in-person and virtual seminars. I would also publish my findings in a formal research paper for future athletes to learn from and enjoy for personal interests.",

    "text": "3.2 Response\n\nIf I were to research a public social media platform, my first thought is that I would initially consider the content to be public since the posts on those platforms are made available to a wide audience. Users understand that is they have a public profile, that anyone on that social media platform can view their postings. Even if an account it private, that doesn’t prevent people from screenshotting or screen recording their content and posting it publicly. However, when consider if informed consent is required is not a straightforward answer. If I was just searching for specific video for my personal entertainment like memes, trending content, or humorous content I wouldn’t feel the need to obtain informed consent because those videos were posted publicly on that platform. If I were to conduct research on a particular topic and need to pull specific quotes or videos for examples, ethically I would feel responsible for obtaining that consent even if their content was posted publicly. For example, for my job I need to get content at the SIUE Rainbow Affinity Welcome event recording the attendees answering some simple questions to be posting on Instagram. A lot of the attendees we ran into didn’t want to be filmed. Although they may post publicly on their own accounts it can be different when it comes to a boarder or audience, they are unaware of. This shows how important context is since people may feel more comfortable posting to their small know circle of followers but not anything wider. Furthermore, this is how some of those gray areas can occur when doing digital research. Although content is made public, ethically that doesn’t mean users view the content the same way as researchers. Additionally, the way one consumer views the content is different from the way another consumer views the content. For example, a TikTok creator with a small following may not expect their content to be used for research purpose. Students at SIUE my not think their personal content would be used in a research study. To begin this approach, I would start with a cautious and respectful approach. If I would offer to remove usernames or blur faces of specific content if the users were on the edge of giving consent to use their content. I would also make sure to explain my goals and share my research in simple, easy to follow language so participants can give well informed answers. I would try my best to not use direct quotes or content that could be easily searched and traced back to the user. Providing paraphrasing and discrete images to still capture any patterns but not expose individuals. I would carefully focus on the participates well-being and privacy by respecting the public nature of social media and the personal intentions behind everyone who post publicly.",

    "text": "4.2 Response\n\nIf I wanted to research a question about misinformation on social media without using any theories, my research would be very surface-level information. For example, I could find different content containing misinformation, including the number of likes, shares, and how quickly that information spreads. Although this data provides some valuable information, I wouldn’t be able to give an explanation as to why the misinformation spreads the way it did. Even looking into how this information influences audiences would be challenging. Without theories, I wouldn’t be collecting data analytics to back up my findings and connect the dots to develop the causes of the research. Theories provide researchers with better frameworks that go beyond the basic definitions and descriptions. For example, if I want to analyze the question about misinformation without theories, I will miss details about social and psychological dynamics that influence people when they engage with content. I might incorrectly assume why people are acting a specific way or why they chose to trust the misinformation, because I can’t back my findings with their motivations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were many false claims going around about the vaccines and treatments online. Theories can help explain why people made those claims and show how political or cultural groups shape what people do and don’t believe. \nAnother level theories adds to research is the ability to make more predictive questions. Without theories, I would only be able to make inferences about the data I’ve collected. For example, how many views the misinformation content received, how to does a platform encourages or discourages the spread of misinformation, or how the word “trust” plays a role in social media platforms, and how the audience evaluate that information. Theories like framing can explain why how wording and visuals can shape people’s perception on certain claims. With agenda-setting, the theory can help reveal why certain false stories get more attention than others. Additional theories like the cultivation theory, show how repeatedly seeing misinformation can shaped peoples long term trust with media portrayed online. These types of questions are only the beginning of the surface-level questions that can dive deeper into areas of solutions, changes, and education strategies. Ultimately, if I research an issue similar to misinformation without any theories, it will make my findings incomplete. The facts and data that I would find would only be the beginning that would need to be backed up to understand the social, cultural context, or generate insights so I can interpret the data and help address the problem. Theories help transform the research into explanations and form my personal observations into understandings for audiences. By including theories, I would be able to include what I see happening and also explain why it matters. .",

    "text": "5.2 Response\n\nAn annotated bibliography and literature reviews serve very different purposes in writing. An annotated bibliography is a collection of sources, with each of them summarized individually. The goal with an annotated bibliography is to explain what the source is about, talk about its credibility, and discuss how the source might be relevant for your research. Each of the summaries stand on its own, paired with the sources like present themselves like a series of notes that can provide a snapshot of the information you’ve gathered. Annotated bibliographies are helpful ways to organize information and keep track of your research materials. In comparison, literature reviews are a blend of multiple sources that highlight patterns, similarities, differences, and gaps within your research. A literature review shows the larger picture of how the research interacts with each other and what they reveal about the topic. Overall, annotated bibliographies show the collection of research, and literature reviews show the analysis and ability to structure your own research.\nA specific paper that I remember collecting multiple sources was for my research paper freshman year. I wrote a big research paper about adoption, and I remember that it was my first time writing an annotated bibliography. I had to record each source I was planning on using and summarize each of them as part of the project. Although it helped me when I was writing my paper to go back to, I didn’t take that extra step to integrate all my findings. This probably made my paper seem like a series a little topics instead of one combined discussion. I wasn’t discussing how the sources related to each other or how they contributed to the topic overall. While this was probably okay back then, I know now how to utilize the literature review to demonstrate a deeper level of knowledge. \nWhen writing my literature review, I want to focus on categorizing my sources based on common findings or contrasting viewpoints. This will help me combine my sources together into a better discussion that flows logically rather than feeling like separate thoughts. For example, if I choose the topic about college athletes and social media, I wouldn’t summarize the different studies I find about X, Instagram, and TnewikTok. I would organize those studies to all relate to different themes about branding, NIL, or social media content to show how the different studies contribute to those themes.  If I do this, the literature review will show what present scholars have said, the areas they agree, disagree, and areas that still need to be studied. I will be able to create a stronger foundation for my own research and better my writing to demonstrate that I understand the bigger picture and can showcase my work within it. –&gt;",

    "text": "6.2 Response\n\nOne of the challenges to today’s research is the effect of self-selection biases. The way a person chooses to participate in a study or engage with online platforms differs from those who do not. These biases can affect findings and lead to misleading results if the issue is not addressed properly. When looking at the study of online news consumption, self-selection biases can easily influence the results of those findings. If a researcher conducts a voluntary online survey that asks participants how often they read the news, the platforms they prefer, and how long they spend consuming current events. People who consume a lot of news by reading the newspaper or online articles will be more likely to take the survey compared to someone who scrolls past the headlines on social media. Furthermore, if a college student is majoring in political science, they may want to participate because they may feel like they have strong feelings about the survey. Compared to other college students who use social media and glance at news headlines regularly but might ignore the survey. This could cause the study to suggest that most people are avid digital news readers, when they are actually a large portion of the population who minimally engage in the news. The same problem can occur when looking at streaming habits. Researchers looking to collect data through volunteers could purpose the question to users about what platforms they subscribe to and how often they watch. Someone who binged watched a show on Netflix or enjoys watching tv may have more to say about streaming and be more likely to participate. Compared to the users who are more casual viewers, or infrequent viewers, they may be more underrepresented. The study may overemphasize binge-watching or the popularity of some streaming platforms over others. Many people may not stream as often or use other alternatives like YouTube or Twitch. The researchers’ finding may not represent the diversity of streaming behaviors of the public. To reduce self-selection biases, it requires a more strategic approach is required. One option is to look at self-reported data with digital tracking. For example, instead of doing just surveys, researchers might look at browsers’ history data or streaming logs, with the participants’ consent. This could provide a more accurate, less biased picture about the behaviors since it does not depend on the participants’ motivation or lifestyle to respond. Self-selection biases have their challenges of making too broad of claims from digital research. Studies about online news consumption or streaming habits can produce valuable insights, but researchers must not make overstated conclusions. Addressing self-selection bias and finding new strategies to limit it can help scholars to produce findings that better reflected the behaviors of the real-world.",

The connections between the two ensure that the research results are valid and meaningful. If the method and question are poorly matched, it can lead to unreliable conclusions and even misleading results. For example, if there was a research question about understanding people’s experiences or perceptions, it would not be paired well with an experiment that involved controlled variables. The research must be directly shaped by the type of question that’s asked so that the data collected can address the research’s goal.\nWith my topic, how athletes represent themselves online and how that affects NIL opportunities, analyzing content comes to mind as an effective method. Analyzing content consists of examining communication like social media posts, videos, or interviews, to look for different recurring themes, patterns, or strategies. This method will work best with questions that look to describe or interpret how specific ideas are communicated or represented in media. For example, if I’m looking at a question like, “How do college athletes present their personal brands on Instagram?” or a hypothesis like, “Athletes who frequently post lifestyle content receive more NIL partnerships than athletes who primarily post sport-related content,” would align properly with content analysis.\nSome of the strengths of content analysis are the ability to move beyond impressions and provide a picture of communication practices. Looking at studying athletes’ self-representation, this method can analyze posts over time as well. It can categorize them into themes like performance highlights, family and personal life, endorsement promotions, or community engagement, and then look for the patterns in that. Interpreting those different themes can help me assess how different types of self-presentation connect to NIL outcomes like sponsorship deals and brand collaborations.\nAdditionally, content analysis is flexible enough to have both quantitative and qualitative elements. Quantitatively, it provides data on frequent counts and trends on how often athletes mention brands. Qualitatively, it can allow for a deeper interpretation of themes like the authenticity of an athlete’s persona or the narratives they create around their identity. These two aspects make content analysis great for examining the intersection of online representation with NIL and measure behaviors with self-expression.\nThe connection between the research question and the methods ensures that the studies are both relevant and trustworthy. With my research top, the content analysis will align with the kinds of questions I would ask about athletes’ online branding and how that shapes NIL opportunities. Examining social media representation, this method will provide both clarity and depth to make this one of the better choices for investigating how athletes make themselves marketable online. It connects those portrayals to the outcomes of NIL opportunities to make my study both relevant and impactful.",
