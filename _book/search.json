    "text": "2.2 Response\n\nIf I were to research a public social media platform, my first thought is that I would initially consider the content to be public since the posts on those platforms are made available to a wide audience. Users understand that if they have a public profile, anyone on that social media platform can view their postings. Even if an account is private, that doesn’t prevent people from screenshoting or screen recording their content and posting it publicly. However, when considering whether informed consent is required, there is no straightforward answer. If I were just searching for specific videos for my personal entertainment, like memes, trending content, or humorous content, I wouldn’t feel the need to obtain informed consent because those videos were posted publicly on that platform. If I were to conduct research on a particular topic and need to pull specific quotes or videos for examples, ethically, I would feel responsible for obtaining that consent even if their content was posted publicly. For example, for my job, I needed to get content at the SIUE Rainbow Affinity Welcome event, recording the attendees answering some simple questions to be posted on Instagram. A lot of the attendees we ran into didn’t want to be filmed. Although they may post publicly on their own accounts, it can be different when it comes to a broader audience they are unaware of. This is how some of those gray areas can occur when doing digital research. Although content is made public, ethically, that doesn’t mean users view the content the same way as researchers. Additionally, the way one consumer interprets content is different from the way another consumer interprets content. For example, a TikTok creator with a small following may not expect their content to be used for research purposes. Students at SIUE may not think their personal content would be used in a research study. To begin this approach, I would start with a cautious and respectful approach. If I were to offer to remove usernames or blur faces of specific content, if the users were on the edge of giving consent to use their content. I would try my best not to use direct quotes or content that could be easily searched and traced back to the user. Providing paraphrasing and discrete images to still capture any patterns, but not expose individuals. I would carefully focus on the participants’ well-being and privacy by respecting the public nature of social media and the personal intentions behind everyone who posts publicly.",

    "text": "3.2 Response\n\nA topic I’m curious about learning more about is how college athletes can use TikTok to build their own personal brand. A research question for that would be “How do collegiate college athletes use TikTok to shape their own personal image and engage with fans. I would begin by looking for popular college athletes on TikTok and look at the type of videos they have on their page. I would investigate their “personal brand” and how they present themselves to the public and how their fans are interacting with their content (likes, comments, shares, and following). I would also review any existing studies on social media branding, digital marketing, and athlete-to-fan communication to have a better understanding of information that’s already been found and any gaps that still need to be researched. I would then work on my design stage, where I would collect TikTok videos posted by NCAA athletes that represent content of them playing their sport, personal life, humor, trends, and endorsements. I would also measure the engagement they receive on those specific posts (likes, comments, shares). I would set up interviews with those specific athletes that I gathered data from to gain their perspective about their own branding strategies, what their goals are with their posts, and how they think their audience perceives them. For the data collecting stage, I would identify between 40-50 athletes who are active on TikTok and gather a specific number of their most recent/most viewed posts (around 15 videos) to keep my data consistent. I would set up a Zoom call with the athletes to interview them and record their responses. In the data analysis stage, I would first examine the engagement the athletes received on their videos and compare them to the type of video it is (ex., lifestyle, humor, trendy). I would see what type of videos gained the most views, likes, shares, and comments. I would then look at the response from the interviews and see if I can identify any patterns from what the athletes said. I would then compare these two sets of data and see if there were any connections between them. In my final step, I would create a presentation of my findings and present them to collegiate athletes through in-person and virtual seminars. I would also publish my findings in a formal research paper for future athletes to learn from and enjoy for personal interests.",

    "text": "4.2 Response\n\nIf I wanted to research a question about misinformation on social media without using any theories, my research would be very surface-level information. For example, I could find different content containing misinformation, including the number of likes, shares, and how quickly that information spreads. Although this data provides some valuable information, I wouldn’t be able to give an explanation as to why the misinformation spreads the way it did. Even looking into how this information influences audiences would be challenging. Without theories, I wouldn’t be collecting data analytics to back up my findings and connect the dots to develop the causes of the research. Theories provide researchers with better frameworks that go beyond the basic definitions and descriptions. For example, if I want to analyze the question about misinformation without theories, I will miss details about social and psychological dynamics that influence people when they engage with content. I might incorrectly assume why people are acting a specific way or why they chose to trust the misinformation, because I can’t back my findings with their motivations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were many false claims going around about the vaccines and treatments online. Theories can help explain why people made those claims and show how political or cultural groups shape what people do and don’t believe. \nAnother level theories adds to research is the ability to make more predictive questions. Without theories, I would only be able to make inferences about the data I’ve collected. For example, how many views the misinformation content received, how to does a platform encourages or discourages the spread of misinformation, or how the word “trust” plays a role in social media platforms, and how the audience evaluate that information. These types of questions are only the beginning of the surface-level questions that can dive deeper into areas of solutions, changes, and education strategies. Ultimately, if I research an issue similar to misinformation without any theories, it will make my findings incomplete. The facts and data that I would find would only be the beginning that would need to be backed up to understand the social, cultural context, or generate insights so I can interpret the data and help address the problem. Theories help transform the research into explanations and form my personal observations into understandings for audiences. By including theories, I would be able to include what I see happening and also explain why it matters.",
