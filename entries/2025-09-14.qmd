  p1: 'Reflect on the metaphor introduced at the beginning of the chapter: walking into a conversation that’s already underway. Have you ever had that experience in real life (in class, online, or at work)? What happened when you did—or didn’t—take the time to listen first? How does that scenario relate to the role of the literature review in research? Why is it important to understand what’s already been said before adding your ideas?'
  p2: 'Think about a media-related topic that interests you (e.g., influencer culture, video game violence, media portrayals of mental health). Now imagine you are preparing to write a literature review on that topic. What kind of “gap” would you look for to justify a new study? Would it be a topical void, a contradiction, or an overlooked perspective? Why does that kind of gap matter in media research?'
  p3: 'In your own words, explain the difference between an annotated bibliography and a proper literature review. Why is that difference significant? Reflect on a time when you had to summarize multiple sources for a paper or project. Did you organize those sources thematically, or treat each one individually? Looking ahead, how will your approach change when writing your literature review?'

## Response

<!-- RESPONSE-START -->

An annotated bibliography and literature reviews serve very different purposes in writing. An annotated bibliography is a collection of sources, with each of them summarized individually. The goal with an annotated bibliography is to explain what the source is about, talk about its credibility, and discuss how the source might be relevant for your research. Each of the summaries stand on its own, paired with the sources like present themselves like a series of notes that can provide a snapshot of the information you’ve gathered. Annotated bibliographies are helpful ways to organize information and keep track of your research materials. In comparison, literature reviews are a blend of multiple sources that highlight patterns, similarities, differences, and gaps within your research. A literature review shows the larger picture of how the research interacts with each other and what they reveal about the topic. Overall, annotated bibliographies show the collection of research, and literature reviews show the analysis and ability to structure your own research.

A specific paper that I remember collecting multiple sources was for my research paper freshman year. I wrote a big research paper about adoption, and I remember that it was my first time writing an annotated bibliography. I had to record each source I was planning on using and summarize each of them as part of the project. Although it helped me when I was writing my paper to go back to, I didn’t take that extra step to integrate all my findings. This probably made my paper seem like a series a little topics instead of one combined discussion. I wasn’t discussing how the sources related to each other or how they contributed to the topic overall. While this was probably okay back then, I know now how to utilize the literature review to demonstrate a deeper level of knowledge. 

When writing my literature review, I want to focus on categorizing my sources based on common findings or contrasting viewpoints. This will help me combine my sources together into a better discussion that flows logically rather than feeling like separate thoughts. For example, if I choose the topic about college athletes and social media, I wouldn’t summarize the different studies I find about X, Instagram, and TikTok. I would organize those studies to all relate to different themes about branding, NIL, or social media content to show how the different studies contribute to those themes.  If I do this, the literature review will show what present scholars have said, the areas they agree, disagree, and areas that still need to be studied. I will be able to create a stronger foundation for my own research and better my writing to demonstrate that I understand the bigger picture and can showcase my work within it. --\>
