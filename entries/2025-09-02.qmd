  p1: 'Think about a claim you’ve seen online that you weren’t sure was true. How would the principles of empiricism and control help you design a study to test whether it was accurate?'
  p2: 'Choose a topic you’re curious about in media or communication (e.g., the effect of streaming on movie watching, how politicians use TikTok, portrayals of families on TV). Write a specific research question about it. Then, briefly describe what you would do in each of the five stages of the research workflow (Conceptualization, Design, Data Collection, Data Analysis, Communication) to answer it.'
  p3: 'Describe a time you learned a digital tool (in any context—school, work, a hobby) without really understanding the reasoning behind what you were doing. How might knowing the "why"—the tool-agnostic principles—have helped you use it more effectively, solve problems, or even choose a better tool for the task?'

A topic I’m curious about learning more about is how college athletes can use TikTok to build their own personal brand. A research question for that would be “How do collegiate college athletes use TikTok to shape their own personal image and engage with fans. I would begin by looking for popular college athletes on TikTok and look at the type of videos they have on their page. I would investigate their “personal brand” and how they present themselves to the public and how their fans are interacting with their content (likes, comments, shares, and following). I would also review any existing studies on social media branding, digital marketing, and athlete-to-fan communication to have a better understanding of information that’s already been found and any gaps that still need to be researched. I would then work on my design stage, where I would collect TikTok videos posted by NCAA athletes that represent content of them playing their sport, personal life, humor, trends, and endorsements. I would also measure the engagement they receive on those specific posts (likes, comments, shares). I would also consider the difference in male and female branding approaches, since my personal exposure has shown that female athletes receive different attention than men. An addition to that, I would look where athletes take advantage of the NIL (name, image, and likeness) offers to promote any endorsements they receive from companies. I would set up interviews with those specific athletes that I gathered data from to gain their perspective about their own branding strategies, what their goals are with their posts, and how they think their audience perceives them. For the data collecting stage, I would identify between 40-50 athletes who are active on TikTok and gather a specific number of their most recent/most viewed posts (around 15 videos) to keep my data consistent. I would set up a Zoom call with the athletes to interview them and record their responses. In the data analysis stage, I would first examine the engagement the athletes received on their videos and compare them to the type of video it is (ex., lifestyle, humor, trendy). I would see what type of videos gained the most views, likes, shares, and comments. I would then look at the response from the interviews and see if I can identify any patterns from what the athletes said. I would then compare these two sets of data and see if there were any connections between them. In my final step, I would create a presentation of my findings and present them to collegiate athletes through in-person and virtual seminars. I would also publish my findings in a formal research paper for future athletes to learn from and enjoy for personal interests.<!-- RESPONSE-END -->
