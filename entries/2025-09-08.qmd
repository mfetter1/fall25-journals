  p1: 'Think of a media-related issue or question you find interesting (e.g., misinformation on social media, representation in film, streaming habits). Now imagine researching that issue without using any theory—just collecting facts. What would be missing from your findings? Reflect on how theory might deepen or improve your ability to explain or understand the issue. What questions might theory help you ask?'
  p2: 'After reading about the social scientific, interpretive, and critical/cultural paradigms, which approach feels most aligned with how you think about research, or how you want to think about it? Why? Share a media topic you care about and describe how your chosen paradigm would shape your research questions, methods, and the kind of insights you might produce.'
  p3: 'Pick one communication theory mentioned in this chapter (e.g., Cultivation Theory, Social Comparison Theory, Feminist Theory). Briefly describe how this theory interprets a real-world communication problem (e.g., violence in media, body image, online harassment). Then reflect on how your understanding of the issue changes when seen through that theoretical lens. What does the theory help you notice that you might not have otherwise?'

## Response

<!-- RESPONSE-START -->

If I wanted to research a question about misinformation on social media without using any theories, my research would be very surface-level information. For example, I could find different content containing misinformation, including the number of likes, shares, and how quickly that information spreads. Although this data provides some valuable information, I wouldn’t be able to give an explanation as to why the misinformation spreads the way it did. Even looking into how this information influences audiences would be challenging. Without theories, I wouldn’t be collecting data analytics to back up my findings and connect the dots to develop the causes of the research. Theories provide researchers with better frameworks that go beyond the basic definitions and descriptions. For example, if I want to analyze the question about misinformation without theories, I will miss details about social and psychological dynamics that influence people when they engage with content. I might incorrectly assume why people are acting a specific way or why they chose to trust the misinformation, because I can’t back my findings with their motivations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there were many false claims going around about the vaccines and treatments online. Theories can help explain why people made those claims and show how political or cultural groups shape what people do and don’t believe. 

Another level theories adds to research is the ability to make more predictive questions. Without theories, I would only be able to make inferences about the data I’ve collected. For example, how many views the misinformation content received, how to does a platform encourages or discourages the spread of misinformation, or how the word “trust” plays a role in social media platforms, and how the audience evaluate that information. These types of questions are only the beginning of the surface-level questions that can dive deeper into areas of solutions, changes, and education strategies. Ultimately, if I research an issue similar to misinformation without any theories, it will make my findings incomplete. The facts and data that I would find would only be the beginning that would need to be backed up to understand the social, cultural context, or generate insights so I can interpret the data and help address the problem. Theories help transform the research into explanations and form my personal observations into understandings for audiences. By including theories, I would be able to include what I see happening and also explain why it matters.  <!-- RESPONSE-END -->
