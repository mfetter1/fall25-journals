  p1: 'Choose either the Nazi medical experiments or the Tuskegee syphilis study and reflect on what that case teaches us about the need for ethical safeguards in research. Why do you think these events had such a lasting impact on how research is conducted today? How might studying these cases shape your behavior as a future researcher?'
  p2: 'Imagine you are researching a public social media platform like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, or TikTok. Would you consider the content you’re analyzing to be public or private? Would you need to obtain informed consent? Why or why not? Reflect on the ethical gray areas that emerge in digital research and how you would navigate them.'
  p3: 'Think ahead to a study you might conduct as part of this course. What would it look like to fully honor the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice in your research? Identify at least one concrete action you would take during your study’s design or data collection to uphold each of these three ethical principles.'

## Response

<!-- RESPONSE-START -->

If I were to research a public social media platform, my first thought is that I would initially consider the content to be public since the posts on those platforms are made available to a wide audience. Users understand that is they have a public profile, that anyone on that social media platform can view their postings. Even if an account it private, that doesn’t prevent people from screenshotting or screen recording their content and posting it publicly. However, when consider if informed consent is required is not a straightforward answer. If I was just searching for specific video for my personal entertainment like memes, trending content, or humorous content I wouldn’t feel the need to obtain informed consent because those videos were posted publicly on that platform. If I were to conduct research on a particular topic and need to pull specific quotes or videos for examples, ethically I would feel responsible for obtaining that consent even if their content was posted publicly. For example, for my job I need to get content at the SIUE Rainbow Affinity Welcome event recording the attendees answering some simple questions to be posting on Instagram. A lot of the attendees we ran into didn’t want to be filmed. Although they may post publicly on their own accounts it can be different when it comes to a boarder or audience, they are unaware of. This shows how important context is since people may feel more comfortable posting to their small know circle of followers but not anything wider. Furthermore, this is how some of those gray areas can occur when doing digital research. Although content is made public, ethically that doesn’t mean users view the content the same way as researchers. Additionally, the way one consumer views the content is different from the way another consumer views the content. For example, a TikTok creator with a small following may not expect their content to be used for research purpose. Students at SIUE my not think their personal content would be used in a research study. To begin this approach, I would start with a cautious and respectful approach. If I would offer to remove usernames or blur faces of specific content if the users were on the edge of giving consent to use their content. I would also make sure to explain my goals and share my research in simple, easy to follow language so participants can give well informed answers. I would try my best to not use direct quotes or content that could be easily searched and traced back to the user. Providing paraphrasing and discrete images to still capture any patterns but not expose individuals. I would carefully focus on the participates well-being and privacy by respecting the public nature of social media and the personal intentions behind everyone who post publicly. <!-- RESPONSE-END -->
